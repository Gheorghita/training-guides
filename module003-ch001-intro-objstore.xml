    <title>Introduction to Object Storage</title>
    <para>OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source
        software for creating redundant, scalable data storage using
        clusters of standardized servers to store petabytes of
        accessible data. It is a long-term storage system for large
        amounts of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and
        updated. Object Storage uses a distributed architecture with
        no central point of control, providing greater scalability,
        redundancy and permanence. Objects are written to multiple
        hardware devices, with the OpenStack software responsible for
        ensuring data replication and integrity across the cluster.
        Storage clusters scale horizontally by adding new nodes.
        Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its content
        from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic
        to ensure data replication and distribution across different
        devices, inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be
        used in lieu of more expensive equipment.</para>
    <para>Object Storage is ideal for cost effective, scale-out
        storage. It provides a fully distributed, API-accessible
        storage platform that can be integrated directly into
        applications or used for backup, archiving and data retention.
        Block Storage allows block devices to be exposed and connected
        to compute instances for expanded storage, better performance
        and integration with enterprise storage platforms, such as
        NetApp, Nexenta and SolidFire.</para>
