Title of your blueprint
==========================================
Developer Training Guide Prerequisites
https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-training-guides/+spec/developer-training-guide-prerequisites

Problem description
===================
Before closing the gap on OpenStack knowledge with deep diving on APIs and fully understanding the CI pipeline, we need
to get the operator or developer to a middle ground where they are ready to be taught agile development. Depending on
the operator or developer background, getting to the point where this material would be useful could be days or months.

Proposed change
===============
Make taking and understanding either of the two online courses required before taking the Developer Training Guide
course.
 * Learn Python the Hard Way http://learnpythonthehardway.org
 * Python Koans https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans

Alternatives
------------
The student can either rely on their existing python skills as being sufficient or use another source like O'Reilly
books.
