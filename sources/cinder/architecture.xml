==========================
The Cinder Block Storage Service is intended to be ran on one or more nodes.
Cinder uses a sql-based central database that is shared by all Cinder services in the system.  The amount and depth of the data fits into a sql database quite well.  For small deployments this seems like an optimal solution.  For larger deployments, and especially if security is a concern, cinder will be moving towards multiple data stores with some kind of aggregation system.
