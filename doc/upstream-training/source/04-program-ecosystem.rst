Old way of adding new Projects
==============================

.. image:: ./_assets/04-02-lifecycle.png
  :width: 100%

- Created too much pressure to `integrate`
- Did not scale
- Superseded by *Big tent* approach with `tags`

OpenStack Project Teams
=======================

- The building blocks to achieve OpenStack's mission
- Teams of people using tools (code repository, bug tracker, etc) and
  coordinated processes to produce a number of deliverables
- The Technical Committee reviews Working Groups interested in
  becoming official OpenStack Project Teams

How to form new Project Team
============================

- Start from groups of people working in the same area
- As these grow naturally they can apply to become Official
- TC will check:

  - Alignment with OpenStack mission
  - Interoperability with other projects
  - Active and diverse team of contributors
  - Group can follow the four *Open*

    - Open Source
    - Open Community
    - Open Design
    - Open Development

Tags describing OpenStack Projects
==================================

- Describe the output produced by the OpenStack community teams

  - Software, documentation, release management etc
  - http://governance.openstack.org/reference/projects/index.html

- Current tags describe how projects are released and team diversity
- Other tags can be proposed by anyone

  - List of approved tags
  - http://governance.openstack.org/reference/tags/index.html

Core (or What is OpenStack)
===========================

.. image:: ./_assets/04-02-defcore.png

- DefCore initiative:

  - guiding principles" used by the Foundation Board to determine how
    commercial implementations of OpenStack can be granted use of the
    trademark

DefCore principles
==================

- Implementations that are Core can use OpenStack trademark
  (OpenStackâ„¢)
- Core is a subset of the whole project
- Claiming OpenStack requiring use of designated upstream code
- Projects must have an open reference implementation
- Vendors may substitute alternate implementations
- Tests can be remotely or self-administered
- A subset of tests are chosen by the Foundation as "must-pass"
- OpenStack Core means passing all "must-pass" tests


Stackforge
==========

  :width: 100%

- Stackforge was used for new unofficial projects, but retired on Aug 2015
- Replaced by Big Tent initiative
- Used the same processes and tools as the main OpenStack projects

Exercise
========

What kind of project do you want to contribute to?
