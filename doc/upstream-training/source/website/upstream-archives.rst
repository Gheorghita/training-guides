OpenStack Upstream Training Archives
====================================

We held the first OpenStack Upstream Training in Atlanta,
before OpenStack Summit Atlanta 2014.
Since Atlanta, we have held the training before every OpenStack Summit.
Besides this "official" event, some user groups hold the local
Upstream trainings.

A big thank you to everyone that has made this possible, especially
Loic Dachary, Stefano Maffulli, Tim Freund, and Marton Kiss
who lead the trainings.
