OpenStack Upstream Institute Class Details
==========================================

Introduction
============

With over 6,000 developers from over 300 different organizations worldwide,
OpenStack is one of the largest collaborative software-development projects.
Because of its size, it is characterized by a huge diversity in social norms
and technical conventions.
These can significantly slow down the speed at which newcomers are successful
at integrating their own roadmap into that of the OpenStack project.

We've designed a training program to provide an interactive environment to
newcomers where they can learn they ways of collaborating with our community.
We are relying on the principles of open collaboration and describe and show
how the ``Four Opens`` work in OpenStack in practice.

The training has a modular structure by which it gives room to attendees with
different job roles.

For example if you are a project or program manager it is very important for
you to understand how the OpenStack releases are structured in order to be able
to plan the roadmap for the product you are responsible for. You might also be
interested in participating in Working Groups to actively participate in and
influence the community in you areas of interest. The training helps you to
find the information entry points you need.

If you are a developer we help you to find your way into the community to get
your bug fix or feature accepted in the OpenStack project in a minimum amount
of time.

The live one and a half day class teaches the students how to navigate the
intricacies of the project's technical tools and social interactions and shows
how they can collaborate with the community and find their place in the
ecosystem.

After the training students have the possibility to sign up for a longer term
mentoring to further stregthen the skills they've learned during the training.
