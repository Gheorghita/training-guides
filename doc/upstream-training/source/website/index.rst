Abstract
========

With over 2,000 developers from over 300 different organizations worldwide,
OpenStack is one of the largest collaborative software-development projects.
Because of its size, it is characterized by a huge diversity in social norms
and technical conventions.
These can significantly slow down the speed at which newcomers are successful
at integrating their own roadmap into that of the OpenStack project.

We've designed a training program to share knowledge about the different ways
of contributing to OpenStack like providing new features, writing
documentation, participating in working groups, and so forth. The educational
program is built on the principle of open collaboration and will teach the
students how to find information and navigate the intricacies of the
projectâ€™s technical tools and social interactions in order to get their
contributions accepted. The live one and a half day class is focusing on
hands-on practice like the students can use a prepared development
environment to learn how to test, prepare and upload new code snippets or
documentation for review. The attendees are also given the opportunity to
join a mentoring program to get further help and guidance on their journey
to become an active and successful member of the OpenStack community.

For more information, see :doc:`upstream-details`.

How to prepare
==============

* Make sure you have a wifi enabled laptop with you.
* Prepared virtual machine image with a development environment:

  * Image and instructions: https://github.com/kmARC/openstack-training-virtual-environment/

* Prepare an environment by yourself from scratch:

  * Create a virtual machine on your laptop with Ubuntu 16.04 installed and
    6+ GB of RAM.
  * Alternatively, you can use your virtual machine on a public cloud.
  * Check that you can ssh from your laptop to the virtual machine
  * Check that :command:`apt install` works on the virtual machine
  * Read and complete the :doc:`irc` guide.
  * Read and complete the :doc:`git` guide.
