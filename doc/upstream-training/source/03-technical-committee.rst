The role of the Technical Committee
===================================

.. rst-class:: colleft

The Technical Committee ("TC") is tasked with providing technical leadership
over all the OpenStack projects. It enforces OpenStack ideals (Openness,
Transparency, Commonality, Integration, Quality), decides on issues affecting
multiple programs, forms an ultimate appeals board for technical decisions,
and generally has oversight over the OpenStack project entirely.

OpenStack Programs
==================

OpenStack "Programs" are efforts which are essential to the completion of the
OpenStack project mission. This mission is to produce the ubiquitous Open
Source cloud computing platform that will meet the needs of public and private
clouds regardless of size, by being simple to implement and massively
scalable. Programs can create any code repository and produce any deliverable
they deem necessary to achieve their goals.

- The official list of programs is in the `governance` repository
   - http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/governance/tree/reference/programs.yaml
- The wiki page: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Category:Programs

Exercise
========

- Exercise

  - read tc.2014-04-01-20.03.log.html and briefly comment on keystone document

Program Technical Leads (PTLs)
==============================

- Manage day-to-day operations
- Drive the program goals
- Resolve technical disputes

Active Program Contributor (APC)
=================================

- Voters for a given program PTL
- Subset of the Foundation Individual Member
- Committed a change over the last two 6-month
- Candidacy for the corresponding program PTL election

Active Technical Contributor (ATC)
======================================

The TC seats are elected by the Active Technical Contributors ("ATC"), which
are a subset of the Foundation Individual Members. Individual Members who
committed a change to a repository under any of the official OpenStack
programs (as defined above) over the last two 6-month release cycles are
automatically considered an ATC.

- TC seats are elected by ATC
- Same as APC
- Bug triagers, technical documentation writers, etc can exceptionally apply
  for ATC

Exercise
========

`Each APC/ATC in the class should add a URL to the etherpad proving it`
