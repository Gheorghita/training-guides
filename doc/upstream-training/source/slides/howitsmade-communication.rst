Ways to Communicate in OpenStack
================================

- Talking in IRC Channels & Meetings
- Wiki Pages
- Etherpads
- Mailing Lists

IRC Channels
============

- Each project and working group has its own channel
- The common syntax: #openstack-<name-of-project>
- Meeting channels (#openstack-meeting, #openstack-meeting-cp, etc.)
- General discussion around what's going on in a project
- Good place to get questions answered

.. notes
   There are a finite number of meeting channels so that meetings are
   spread around. This is enforced by infra. The #openstack-meeting-cp
   channel is special in that it is dedicated to cross project efforts.

IRC Meetings
============

.. notes
   Usually follow an agenda, more structured discussion than in the project
   specific channel

- IRC meetings: http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/
- Others: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Meetings

IRC Logs
========

- Logs of meetings are archived so that they can be referenced later on
- http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/

Exercise 1
==========

Join the channel of the project(s) you are interested in and find the
logs from the most recent meeting.

Wiki Pages
==========

- Each project and working group also has its own wiki page
    - https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Main_Page
- Good source of info about when and in what channel regular meetings are held
- Generally has information about who the PTL and cores are

Exercise 2
==========

Look up when the next meeting is for the channel you joined and where
the meeting is (#openstack-meeting, #openstack-meeting-3, etc).

Etherpads
=========

- Common place to have people in a project collaborate on larger projects
  and planning of events
- No master list of etherpads - harder to find what you are looking for
  without having looked at it before or without asking for the URL

Mailing Lists (ML)
==================

- More than 40 different ML's
- http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo
- Way for people to communicate to a larger group than those that
  are on IRC
- All emails are archived

Exercise 3
==========

Look through the list of mailing lists and subscribe to at least
one that would be most helpful for you and then locate where the archives
for that ML are.
