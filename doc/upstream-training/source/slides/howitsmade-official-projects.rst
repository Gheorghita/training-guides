Official OpenStack projects
===========================
- `Requirements <https://governance.openstack.org/reference/new-projects-requirements.html>`_
  for official OpenStack projects
- Projects improve and grow independently but also strive to improve one
  collaborative framework: OpenStack

 - Projects APIs are documented within the project
 - Testable on its own
 - Dashboard (horizon) and DevStack provide plugin interface for easy
   integration
 - Core and mature Big Tent projects are tracked in the
   `Project Navigator <https://www.openstack.org/software/project-navigator>`_

- Big Tent is a code name for the official OpenStack projects

 .. note::

  - Not all projects are currently tracked in Project Navigator.  The goal,
    however, is for it to be an ever growing list.

Benefits of being an Official OpenStack project
===============================================
- Contributors get to vote in the Technical Committee election
- Can publish to docs.openstack.org and developer.openstack.org

- Get marketing from the OpenStack Foundation
- Can participate in common programs, like mentoring and internship to help
  with on boarding

  - The OpenStack Foundation participates in internship programs as
    `Outreachy <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Outreachy>`_.
  - Official OpenStack projects can participate by offering topics and mentors
    for the interns who sign up for this program.

Core and Optional Services
==========================
- Core services are OpenStack projects and essential in every OpenStack-powered
  IaaS cloud or product
- Optional services are also OpenStack projects but not necessarily needed to
  operate OpenStack depending on use cases
