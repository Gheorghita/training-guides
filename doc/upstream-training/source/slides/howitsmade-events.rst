Project Team Gathering (PTG)
============================

- A gathering of projects teams and contributors
- Dedicated and detailed technical discussions
- Useful for participants if they are already working with a

OpenStack Design Summit
=======================

Where developers meet face to face to finalize planning for the next release
cycle.

.. note
   This format is being deprecated and this Summit is the last where this will
   be the format.

How does it work?
=================

- Not a classic conference with presenter and audience

  - more like a collaborative brainstorming session

- Discuss upcoming features for the next release cycle
- Not suitable to start learning about a topic
