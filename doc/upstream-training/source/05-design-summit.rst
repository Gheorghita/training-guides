OpenStack Design Summit
=======================

Where developers meet face to face to finalize planning for the next release
cycle.

How does it work?
==================

- Not a classic conference with presenter and audience
  - more like a collaborative brainstorming session
- Discuss upcoming features for the next release cycle
- Not suitable to start learning about a topic
