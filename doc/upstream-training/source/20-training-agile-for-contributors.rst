Fitting it all together
=======================

- Building software in a community looks really complicated
- To understand how it all fits together, we use a hands on example
- In this example, we use Lego to represent a software project
- We will take on roles to show how each community member interacts
- Hopefully we end up with a unique Lego creation!

Using Lego to represent the community
=====================================

- Like any software project, there are:

  - Developers
  - Managers
  - Product owners

- Like OpenStack, there are:

  - Foundation, technical committee, and board members
  - PTLs
  - Core team
  - Companies
  - Unaffiliated contributors (free agents)

Your mission, should you choose to accept it
============================================

Build a street out of Lego. All buildings must be connected by road and
sidewalk. The Foundation, TC, and Board must approve the overall design
of the street.

Aim to become a major contributor and demonstrate your mad skills!

Choosing roles - Upstream
=========================

- Board : 1
- Technical committee : 1
- PTL : 1
- Core : 5

Upstream is responsible for the finished product.

Choosing roles - Companies
==========================

- 3-4 different companies

Each company has:

- CEO : 1
- Team members : 3-5

Companies have to deliver value to their stakeholders.

Choosing roles - Free agent contributors
========================================

- Distracted : 1
- Controversial : 1
- Agreeable : 2-3

Each individual sets their own objective.

Timing
======

- Four sprints of 30 mins:

  - 5 mins planning
  - 20 mins building
  - 5 mins review

Communication
=============

- Be polite, be helpful
- Listen when people talk
- Be true to your role
- If you feel the community needs consensus, call a midcycle!

Let's play!
