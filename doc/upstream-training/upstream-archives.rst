OpenStack Upstream Training Archives
====================================

We held the first OpenStack Upstream Training in Atlanta,
before OpenStack Summit Atlanta 2014.
Since Atlanta, we have held the training before every OpenStack Summit.
Also, some user groups hold the local upstream training in their country.

We are appreciating all staffs, especially Loic Dachary, Stefano Maffulli,
and Tim Freund who lead the training respectively.
