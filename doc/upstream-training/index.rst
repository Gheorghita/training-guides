OpenStack Upstream Training
===========================

Abstract
========

With over 2000 developers from 80 different companies worldwide, OpenStack is
one of the largest collaborative software-development projects. Because of its
size, it is characterized by a huge diversity in social norms and technical
conventions. These can significantly slow down the speed at which newcomers
are successful at integrating their own roadmap into that of the OpenStack
project.

We've designed a training program to help professional developers negotiate
this hurdle. It shows them how to ensure their bug fix or feature is accepted
in the OpenStack project in a minimum amount of time. The educational program
requires students to work on real-life bug fixes or new features during two
days of real-life classes and online mentoring, until the work is accepted by
OpenStack. The live two-day class teaches them to navigate the intricacies of
the project's technical tools and social interactions. In a followup session,
the students benefit from individual online sessions to help them resolve any
remaining problems they might have.
