                the cluster, representing distinct physical locations
                such as cities or countries. Similar to zones but
                representing physical locations of portions of the
                cluster rather than logical segments.</para>

    <para>This document describes each storage node as a separate zone
        in the ring. At a minimum, five zones are recommended. A zone
        is a group of nodes that are as isolated as possible from other
        nodes (separate servers, network, power, even geography). The
        ring guarantees that every replica is stored in a separate
        zone. This diagram shows one possible configuration for a
        minimal installation:</para>
