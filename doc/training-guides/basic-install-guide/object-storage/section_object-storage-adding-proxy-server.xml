                <title>Add another proxy server</title>
                <para>To provide additional reliability and bandwidth
                        to your cluster, you can add proxy servers. You can
                        set up an additional proxy node the same way
                        that you set up the first proxy node but with
                        additional configuration steps.</para>
                <para>After you have more than two proxies, you must
                        load balance them; your storage endpoint (what
                        clients use to connect to your storage) also
                        changes. You can select from different
                        strategies for load balancing. For example,
                        you could use round-robin DNS, or a software
                        or hardware load balancer (like pound) in
                        front of the two proxies. You can then point your
                        storage URL to the load balancer, configure an initial
                        proxy node and complete these steps to add proxy
                        servers.</para>
