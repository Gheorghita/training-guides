    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>The <glossterm>OpenStack</glossterm> project is an open source cloud
      computing platform that supports all types of cloud environments. The
      project aims for simple implementation, massive scalability, and a rich
      set of features. Cloud computing experts from around the world
      contribute to the project.</para>
    <para>OpenStack provides an Infrastructure-as-a-Service
      (<glossterm>IaaS</glossterm>) solution through a variety of complemental
      services. Each service offers an application programming interface
      (<glossterm>API</glossterm>) that facilitates this integration. The
      following table provides a list of OpenStack services:</para>
  <xi:include href="http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/openstack-manuals/plain/doc/common/ch_getstart.xml"
      xpointer="element(table1)"/>
    <para>This guide describes how to deploy these services in a functional
      test environment and, by example, teaches you how to build a production
      environment.</para>

    <para>Launching a virtual machine or instance involves many interactions
      among several services. The following diagram provides the conceptual
      architecture of a typical OpenStack environment.</para>

    <para>OpenStack is highly configurable to meet different needs with various
      compute, networking, and storage options. This guide enables you to
      choose your own OpenStack adventure using a combination of basic and
      optional services. This guide uses the following example
      architectures:</para>

          <para>Three-node architecture with OpenStack Networking (neutron).

          <listitem>
            <para>The basic controller node runs the Identity service, Image
              Service, management portions of Compute and Networking,
              Networking plug-in, and the dashboard. It also includes
              supporting services such as a database,
              <glossterm>message broker</glossterm>, and
              <glossterm>Network Time Protocol (NTP)</glossterm>.
            </para>
            <para>Optionally, the controller node also runs portions of
              Block Storage, Object Storage, Database Service, Orchestration,
              and Telemetry. These components provide additional features for
              your environment.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>The network node runs the Networking plug-in, layer 2 agent,
              and several layer 3 agents that provision and operate tenant
              networks. Layer 2 services include provisioning of virtual
              networks and tunnels. Layer 3 services include routing,
              <glossterm baseform="Network Address Translation (NAT)">NAT</glossterm>
              , and <glossterm>DHCP</glossterm>. This node also handles
              external (internet) connectivity for tenant virtual machines
              or instances.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>The compute node runs the hypervisor portion of Compute,
              which operates tenant virtual machines or instances. By default
              Compute uses KVM as the hypervisor. The compute node also runs
              the Networking plug-in and layer 2 agent which operate tenant
              networks and implement security groups. You can run more than
              one compute node.</para>
            <para>Optionally, the compute node also runs the Telemetry
              agent. This component provides additional features for
              your environment.</para>
